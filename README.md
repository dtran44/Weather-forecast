# Weather-forecast

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a Weather Dashboard using the openWeather API. Specifically, I learnt how to: 

- Create API calls to fetch the current day forecast and 5 day forecast
- Store the user's city search into local storage and show that retrieved data on the page
