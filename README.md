# Weather-forecast

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a Weather Dashboard using the openWeather API. Specifically, I learnt how to: 

- Create API calls to fetch the current day forecast and 5 day forecast with the temperture, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed and icon representation of the weather 
- Store the user's city search into local storage and show that retrieved data on the page. If the retrieved data is clicked, this will show the current and 5 day forecast
